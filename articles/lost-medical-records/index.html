            <p class="lp-section-text">
                Your employer needs proof of vaccinations. Your new doctor wants your surgical history. The hospital is asking about medications you took three years ago. And you're digging through boxes, calling old offices, and filling out forms to request records that take weeks to arrive.
            </p>
            <p class="lp-section-text">
                According to research from the <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/data/quickstats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT</a>, while over 90% of hospitals now use electronic health records, these systems often don't communicate with each other. Your health information ends up siloed in different portals, different formats, and different states.
            </p>
            <p class="lp-section-text">
                The problem is compounded by how often Americans change healthcare providers. The average person sees <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/physician-visits.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4 different healthcare providers per year</a> according to CDC data, and most people switch primary care doctors multiple times during their lifetime. Each transition creates another gap in the continuity of your medical history.

            <h3 class="lp-subsection-title">Finding Lost Vaccination Records</h3>
            <p class="lp-section-text">
                Vaccination records are among the most commonly requested — and most commonly lost — medical documents. Here's where to look:
            </p>
            <ul class="lp-benefit-list">
                <li><strong>State Immunization Registry:</strong> Most states maintain an Immunization Information System (IIS). Contact your state health department or search for "[your state] immunization registry" to access your records.</li>
                <li><strong>Childhood Pediatrician:</strong> If you still know who your pediatrician was, they may have records on file. Records are typically kept for 7-10 years after your last visit or until you turn 21.</li>
                <li><strong>Schools:</strong> K-12 schools and colleges often keep immunization records as part of enrollment requirements.</li>
                <li><strong>Military Records:</strong> If you served, your vaccination records are part of your military medical file, accessible through the <a href="https://www.archives.gov/veterans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Archives</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Employers:</strong> If vaccines were required for your job (healthcare workers, international assignments), your employer may have records.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="lp-subsection-title">Finding Records from Closed Medical Practices</h3>
            <p class="lp-section-text">
                When a doctor retires or a practice closes, your records don't disappear — but finding them can be challenging:
            </p>
            <ul class="lp-benefit-list">
                <li><strong>Contact your state medical board:</strong> They may know where records were transferred or who is responsible for maintaining them.</li>
                <li><strong>Check with affiliated hospitals:</strong> If your doctor was affiliated with a hospital or health system, records may be accessible through them.</li>
                <li><strong>Search for the practice's successor:</strong> Many practices are purchased by or merged with other practices that inherit patient records.</li>
                <li><strong>Contact your health insurance company:</strong> They may have claims data that includes diagnoses, procedures, and prescriptions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="lp-subsection-title">Using Patient Portals</h3>
            <p class="lp-section-text">
                If you've received care in the last several years, check if your providers have patient portals. Many now offer:
            </p>
            <ul class="lp-benefit-list">
                <li>Lab results and imaging reports</li>
                <li>Immunization records</li>
                <li>Visit summaries and clinical notes</li>
                <li>Medication history</li>
                <li>Options to download or print your records</li>

            <div class="lp-faq-item">
                <h3 class="lp-faq-question">How do I find my old vaccination records?</h3>
                <p class="lp-faq-answer">Start by contacting your state's immunization registry (IIS), as most states maintain records of vaccinations. You can also check with your childhood pediatrician, schools you attended, previous employers (for work-required vaccines), or the military if you served. Your health insurance company may also have vaccination claims records.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="lp-faq-item">
                <h3 class="lp-faq-question">What if my doctor's office closed and I need my records?</h3>
                <p class="lp-faq-answer">When a medical practice closes, records are typically transferred to another provider, a medical records storage company, or the state medical board. Contact your state medical board or health department for help locating records from closed practices. Hospital records may be kept by the hospital system even if an associated physician has left.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="lp-faq-item">
                <h3 class="lp-faq-question">How long do hospitals keep medical records?</h3>
                <p class="lp-faq-answer">Retention periods vary by state, but most require hospitals to keep adult records for 5-10 years after discharge or last treatment. Pediatric records are typically kept until the patient reaches age 18-21, plus an additional period (often 5-7 years). Medicare requires records be kept for at least 5 years.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="lp-faq-item">
                <h3 class="lp-faq-question">Can I get copies of my medical records for free?</h3>
                <p class="lp-faq-answer">Under <a href="/articles/medical-records-rights/">HIPAA</a>, providers can charge reasonable fees for paper copies but must provide electronic copies at low or no cost. Many patient portals offer free access to lab results, visit summaries, and immunization records. Some states cap medical records fees or require free copies in certain situations.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="lp-faq-item">
                <h3 class="lp-faq-question">How do I find records if I've moved to a new state?</h3>
                <p class="lp-faq-answer">Contact your previous healthcare providers directly to request records be transferred. You have the right under HIPAA to receive copies of your records regardless of where you now live. Many providers can fax or electronically transfer records to your new doctor. Consider using a personal health record to maintain your own copies.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="lp-faq-item">
                <h3 class="lp-faq-question">What records should I keep copies of?</h3>
                <p class="lp-faq-answer">Keep copies of immunization records, major diagnoses and conditions, surgical reports, current medications, allergies, lab results (especially trend-tracking like cholesterol), imaging reports, and family health history. These are the records most frequently needed for new doctors, emergencies, and insurance purposes.</p>
