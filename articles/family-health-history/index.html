            <p class="lp-section-text">
                "What did grandpa die from?" You remember heart problems, but was it a heart attack? Heart failure? At what age? "Does cancer run in our family?" Your aunt had breast cancer, but what about your grandmother's sisters? What type of cancer was it, and when was she diagnosed?
            </p>
            <p class="lp-section-text">
                Every new patient form asks about family history, but most people check "unknown" for many boxes. According to the U.S. Surgeon General, while nearly all Americans believe family health history is important, only about one-third have actively collected this information from their relatives.

            <h2 class="lp-section-title">Why Family Health History Matters: The Science</h2>
            <p class="lp-section-text">
                The National Institutes of Health (NIH) identifies family health history as a critical tool for identifying people at increased risk for disease. Your genes, combined with shared environmental factors and behaviors, create patterns that can predict your health trajectory.
            </p>
            <div class="lp-content-block">
                <h3 class="lp-content-subtitle">The Genetic Connection</h3>
                <p class="lp-section-text">
                    Research from the CDC shows that people with a family history of chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and cancer are 2-3 times more likely to develop these conditions themselves. This increased risk comes from inherited genetic variants that can predispose you to certain health problems.
                </p>
                <p class="lp-section-text">
                    However, genetics is only part of the picture. Families also share environments, habits, and behaviors. If heart disease runs in your family, it may be partly genetic, but also related to shared dietary patterns, activity levels, or exposure to secondhand smoke. Understanding this distinction helps you identify which risk factors you can control.

                <p class="lp-story-quote">"My doctor found my breast cancer early because I told her about my aunt and grandmother. She ordered a mammogram at 38 instead of waiting until 40. That early detection probably saved my life. I wish I'd known more about my family history sooner."</p>

            <p class="lp-section-text">
                Stories like Maria's are common in preventive medicine. The NIH reports that women with a first-degree relative (mother, sister, or daughter) with breast cancer have approximately twice the risk of developing breast cancer compared to women without this family history. For certain genetic mutations like BRCA1 and BRCA2, the lifetime risk can be as high as 70%.

                    Family gatherings and holidays are ideal times to discuss health history. The Surgeon General designates Thanksgiving as National Family Health History Day to encourage these conversations. Approach the topic sensitively, as some family members may be reluctant to discuss health issues.

            <h2 class="lp-section-title">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <div class="lp-faq-item">
                <h3 class="lp-faq-question">Why is family health history important for my healthcare?</h3>
                <p class="lp-faq-answer">Family health history is one of the strongest predictors of disease risk. According to the CDC, many conditions like heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers run in families. Knowing your family history helps doctors recommend appropriate screenings, preventive measures, and lifestyle changes tailored to your genetic risk profile.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="lp-faq-item">
                <h3 class="lp-faq-question">Which conditions are most influenced by family history?</h3>
                <p class="lp-faq-answer">The most significant hereditary conditions include heart disease, stroke, Type 2 diabetes, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer, and high blood pressure. Mental health conditions like depression and bipolar disorder, as well as autoimmune diseases, also have strong genetic components.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="lp-faq-item">
                <h3 class="lp-faq-question">How many generations of family health history should I collect?</h3>
                <p class="lp-faq-answer">The Surgeon General recommends collecting health information from at least three generations: your parents, your grandparents, and your siblings. If available, information about aunts, uncles, and cousins can provide additional insight into hereditary patterns.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="lp-faq-item">
                <h3 class="lp-faq-question">What specific information should I document about each family member?</h3>
                <p class="lp-faq-answer">For each family member, document major medical conditions, age at diagnosis, cause of death (if applicable), ethnicity or origin, and lifestyle factors like smoking or obesity. Include both maternal and paternal sides of the family for a complete picture.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="lp-faq-item">
                <h3 class="lp-faq-question">Can I reduce my risk even if a disease runs in my family?</h3>
                <p class="lp-faq-answer">Yes, having a family history does not guarantee you will develop a condition. The CDC notes that lifestyle modifications like maintaining a healthy weight, exercising regularly, not smoking, and eating a balanced diet can significantly reduce your risk even with genetic predisposition. Early screening also enables earlier intervention.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="lp-faq-item">
                <h3 class="lp-faq-question">When should I share my family health history with my doctor?</h3>
                <p class="lp-faq-answer">Share your family health history at every new patient appointment, annual physical, and whenever you learn new information about a family member's health. Update your records when relatives receive new diagnoses or if there are changes in your family medical history.</p>
