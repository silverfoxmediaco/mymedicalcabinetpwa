                A medication error is any preventable event that may cause or lead to inappropriate medication use or patient harm. These errors can occur at any stage of the medication process: prescribing, transcribing, dispensing, administering, or monitoring.

            <h3 class="lp-subsection-title">Common Types of Medication Errors</h3>
            <ul class="lp-list">
                <li><strong>Wrong dosage:</strong> Receiving too much or too little of a medication</li>
                <li><strong>Wrong medication:</strong> Being dispensed a different drug than prescribed</li>

                An adverse drug event (ADE) is any injury resulting from medication use, including adverse reactions, overdoses, and harm from medication errors. While some ADEs are unavoidable (such as previously unknown allergic reactions), many are preventable through proper medication management.

            <p class="lp-section-text">
                The FDA estimates that ADEs cause more than 125,000 deaths per year in the United States, making them one of the leading causes of death nationwide.<sup>[1]</sup> The elderly are particularly vulnerable — patients over 65 are twice as likely to visit an emergency department due to an adverse drug event and seven times more likely to be hospitalized.<sup>[2]</sup>

            <p class="lp-section-text">
                The good news is that many medication errors are preventable. According to the WHO, up to 50% of medication harm is avoidable.<sup>[3]</sup> Here are evidence-based strategies to protect yourself and your loved ones:
            </p>
            <h3 class="lp-subsection-title">1. Maintain a Complete Medication List</h3>
            <p class="lp-section-text">
                Keep an up-to-date list of all medications, including prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, vitamins, and supplements. Include dosages, frequencies, and the prescribing physician for each medication.
            </p>
            <h3 class="lp-subsection-title">2. Document All Allergies</h3>
            <p class="lp-section-text">
                Maintain a comprehensive list of drug allergies and adverse reactions you've experienced. Include the medication name and the type of reaction (rash, breathing difficulty, etc.).
            </p>
            <h3 class="lp-subsection-title">3. Verify Your Prescriptions</h3>
            <p class="lp-section-text">
                When picking up medications from the pharmacy, verify the medication name, dosage, and appearance match what was prescribed. Don't hesitate to ask your pharmacist questions.
            </p>
            <h3 class="lp-subsection-title">4. Use Technology to Your Advantage</h3>
            <p class="lp-section-text">
                Medication tracking apps like MyMedicalCabinet can automatically check for drug interactions, send reminders for doses and refills, and store your complete medication history securely.
            </p>
            <h3 class="lp-subsection-title">5. Communicate with Your Healthcare Team</h3>
            <p class="lp-section-text">
                Always inform every healthcare provider about all medications you're taking. This is especially important when seeing specialists or visiting emergency departments.
