            <p class="lp-section-text">
                Many patients don't realize they have significant legal rights over their own medical information. Whether you need records for a new doctor, an insurance claim, a legal matter, or simply to understand your health history, federal law guarantees your access.
            </p>
            <p class="lp-section-text">
                The <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-individuals/guidance-materials-for-consumers/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)</a>, passed in 1996, establishes your fundamental right to access your protected health information (PHI). According to the <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/access/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</a>, this right applies to nearly all healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses.
            </p>
            <p class="lp-section-text">
                Despite these clear legal protections, many patients encounter obstacles when trying to obtain their records. A <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2021.01485" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2022 study published in Health Affairs</a> found that patients frequently face delays, excessive fees, and even outright denials when requesting their medical records — many of which violate federal law.

            <p class="lp-section-text">
                Under HIPAA, you have the right to access your "designated record set" — the medical and billing records your healthcare provider uses to make decisions about your care. This includes:
            </p>
            <ul class="lp-benefit-list">
                <li><strong>Clinical Records:</strong> Doctor's notes, physical exam findings, diagnoses, treatment plans, and progress notes</li>
                <li><strong>Test Results:</strong> Laboratory work, blood tests, pathology reports, and genetic testing</li>
                <li><strong>Imaging:</strong> X-rays, MRIs, CT scans, ultrasounds, and mammograms (you can request copies of the actual images, not just reports)</li>
                <li><strong>Medication Records:</strong> Prescription history, pharmacy records, and medication administration records</li>
                <li><strong>Billing Records:</strong> Itemized bills, insurance claims, and payment history</li>
                <li><strong>Correspondence:</strong> Referral letters, consultation reports, and communications between providers</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="lp-subsection-title">Limited Exceptions to Access</h3>
            <p class="lp-section-text">
                There are very few situations where a provider can legally deny you access to your records:
            </p>
            <ul class="lp-benefit-list">
                <li><strong>Psychotherapy Notes:</strong> Private notes kept separately by mental health professionals</li>
                <li><strong>Information Compiled for Legal Proceedings:</strong> Records prepared in anticipation of litigation</li>
                <li><strong>Lab Results Covered by CLIA:</strong> Certain lab results have separate access rules</li>
                <li><strong>Safety Concerns:</strong> If a licensed professional believes access would endanger you or another person</li>

                <p class="lp-faq-answer">Yes. Under HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), you have the legal right to access and obtain copies of your medical records. This includes records held by doctors, hospitals, clinics, pharmacies, insurance companies, and other healthcare entities covered by HIPAA.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="lp-faq-item">
                <h3 class="lp-faq-question">How long does a provider have to give me my records?</h3>
                <p class="lp-faq-answer">Healthcare providers must respond to your request within 30 days. They can extend this by an additional 30 days (60 days total) if they provide written notice explaining the delay. Electronic records through patient portals are often available immediately.</p>

            <div class="lp-faq-item">
                <h3 class="lp-faq-question">Can providers charge me for copies of my medical records?</h3>
                <p class="lp-faq-answer">Providers can charge reasonable, cost-based fees for copying and mailing paper records. They cannot charge for searching or retrieving records. Electronic copies must be provided at no charge or minimal cost. Many states cap medical records fees, typically ranging from $0.25-$1.00 per page.</p>

            <div class="lp-faq-item">
                <h3 class="lp-faq-question">Can a provider deny my request for medical records?</h3>
                <p class="lp-faq-answer">Denials are rare and only permitted in specific circumstances, such as if releasing records would endanger you or someone else, or for psychotherapy notes. If denied, providers must give you a written explanation and inform you of your right to appeal or file a complaint.</p>

                <p class="lp-faq-answer">First, request a written explanation for the denial. Then, you can file a complaint with the <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/filing-a-complaint/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights (OCR)</a>.

                <h3 class="lp-faq-question">Can I access my child's medical records?</h3>
                <p class="lp-faq-answer">Generally yes. Parents or legal guardians can access medical records for minor children. However, some state laws give adolescents privacy rights for certain types of care (like mental health or reproductive health). Once a child turns 18, they control access to their own records.</p>

            <div class="lp-faq-item">
                <h3 class="lp-faq-question">How long do providers keep medical records?</h3>
                <p class="lp-faq-answer">Retention periods vary by state and record type, but most states require providers to keep adult records for 5-10 years after the last treatment. Pediatric records are typically kept until the child reaches age 18-21 plus several years. Medicare records must be kept for 5 years.</p>
