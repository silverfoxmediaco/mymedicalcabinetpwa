2026-01-31: SEO Landing Pages (10 Pages)
----------------------------------------
Created 10 static HTML landing pages with AdSense integration.

IMPORTANT LESSON LEARNED:
Before building new features, ALWAYS check the existing codebase for similar
implementations. The /articles/ folder already had static HTML landing pages
(your-health-your-records, medical-records-rights). I initially built React
JSX components which was wrong - had to redo everything as static HTML to
match the existing pattern. Check existing patterns first, then build.

Location: /articles/ folder (static HTML, not React components)

Pages Created:
1. /articles/lost-medical-records/
2. /articles/elderly-parent-care/
3. /articles/emergency-room-ready/
4. /articles/medication-management/
5. /articles/switching-doctors/

7. /articles/family-health-history/
8. /articles/medication-errors/

2026-02-01: My Appointments Page Fix
------------------------------------
Fixed: My Appointments page displaying blank (same issue as My Insurance)

Root Cause:
- Backend API returns {success, count, data:[...]} format
- appointmentService.getAll() returned full response object
- Page called .filter() on object instead of array, causing TypeError

Fixed Files:
/client/src/services/appointmentService.js
- getAll() now extracts result.data || [] from response
- getById() now extracts result.data || null from response
- getUpcoming() now extracts result.data || [] from response

Note: This is the same pattern fix applied to insuranceService.js earlier

   - title field missing from model

2. Appointment time displaying wrong (1pm showed as 7:30am)

- Added .normalizeEmail() to all email validation chains (register, login, resend-verification-by-email)
- Added .trim().escape() to firstName and lastName in registration

server/routes/insurance.js:
- Added .trim() to provider.name and memberId validation chains

server/package.json:
- Added helmet, express-mongo-sanitize, morgan, hpp dependencies

OWASP Top 10 Coverage:
1. Injection: express-mongo-sanitize + express-validator + Mongoose schemas
2. Broken Authentication: JWT tokens, bcrypt password hashing, rate limiting on auth routes
3. Sensitive Data Exposure: HTTPS (Render enforced), no secrets in responses
4. XXE: express.json() parser (not XML-based)
5. Broken Access Control: protect middleware, userId ownership checks on all routes
6. Security Misconfiguration: helmet security headers, CSP policy
7. XSS: helmet X-XSS-Protection, .escape() on user input, CSP
8. Insecure Deserialization: JSON-only API, no object serialization
9. Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities: up-to-date dependencies
10. Insufficient Logging: morgan combined logging for all requests

2026-02-05: Wellmark FHIR Patient Access API Integration
---------------------------------------------------------
Built complete OAuth 2.0 connection flow and FHIR data sync for Wellmark BCBS.
Members tap "Connect to Wellmark" on their insurance plan, authenticate with
Wellmark, and MMC auto-populates coverage, claims, medications, conditions,
and provider data.

New Files (4):
- server/services/fhirService.js: Reusable FHIR service with provider config map (Wellmark BCBS), OAuth functions (getAuthorizationUrl, exchangeCodeForTokens, refreshAccessToken), FHIR data fetching (fetchResource, fetchPatientData for Coverage/Claim/Condition/MedicationRequest/Immunization/Encounter/Procedure/Practitioner), mapCoverageToInsurance helper, generateStateToken utility
- client/src/components/Insurance/ConnectInsurance/ConnectInsurance.jsx: Connect/sync UI component - not-connected state shows "Connect to Wellmark" button; connected state shows green badge, last synced timestamp, Sync Now button with spinner, Disconnect button. All CSS classes prefixed fhir-connect-
- client/src/components/Insurance/ConnectInsurance/ConnectInsurance.css: Blue gradient container, status badges, sync/disconnect button styles, spinner animation, mobile responsive
- client/src/components/Insurance/ConnectInsurance/index.js: Barrel export

Modified Files:
- server/models/Insurance.js: Added `provider` to fhirConnection subdocument; added `fhirData` subdocument (coverage Mixed, claims/conditions/medications/immunizations/encounters/practitioners/procedures arrays, lastFetched date)
- server/routes/insurance.js: Added fhirService import; replaced POST /connect-fhir stub with GET /fhir/authorize/:provider (generates state token, builds OAuth URL); added GET /fhir/callback (decodes state, exchanges code for tokens, updates Insurance record, redirects to frontend); replaced POST /:id/sync stub with real implementation (token refresh, fetchPatientData, map coverage, store raw FHIR data); added POST /:id/disconnect (clears tokens and fhirData)
- client/src/services/insuranceService.js: Added getFhirAuthUrl(provider), syncFhirData(insuranceId), disconnectFhir(insuranceId)
- client/src/components/Insurance/InsuranceModal/InsuranceModal.jsx: Imported ConnectInsurance; added onFhirSync prop; renders ConnectInsurance in Basic Info tab (edit mode only)
- client/src/components/Insurance/InsuranceCard/InsuranceCard.jsx: Added "Synced" badge when fhirConnection.connected is true
- client/src/components/Insurance/InsuranceCard/InsuranceCard.css: Added .insurance-badge.fhir-synced style (blue)
- client/src/pages/MyInsurance/MyInsurance.jsx: Added useSearchParams; FHIR callback handler (detects ?fhir=success/error, shows toast, cleans URL); handleFhirSync function; passes onFhirSync to InsuranceModal
- client/src/pages/MyInsurance/MyInsurance.css: Added .fhir-toast notification styles (fixed position, slide-in animation, success/error variants)
- .env: Added WELLMARK_FHIR_BASE_URL, WELLMARK_AUTH_URL, WELLMARK_TOKEN_URL, WELLMARK_CLIENT_ID, WELLMARK_CLIENT_SECRET, WELLMARK_SANDBOX_KEY, CLIENT_URL

2026-02-05: Fix duplicate appointment reminder emails
------------------------------------------------------
Bug: Appointment reminder emails were sent repeatedly every 15 minutes
instead of once per reminder window. The reminderService writes a `timing`
field ('24h' or '2h') to the remindersSent array to track which reminders
have been sent, but the Appointment schema was missing the `timing` field.
Mongoose silently stripped it on save, so the dedup check always failed.

- server/models/Appointment.js: Added `timing` field (String, enum ['24h', '2h']) to remindersSent subdocument schema
- server/services/reminderService.js: Fixed dedup check to also match legacy entries without timing field; switched from findByIdAndUpdate $push to appointment.save() so Mongoose schema validation runs and timing field persists

2026-02-05: Insurance Card "View" Button — Read-Only Modal
-----------------------------------------------------------
Added a "View" button to each InsuranceCard so members can see all their
plan details (coverage, copays, deductible progress, documents) in a clean
read-only modal. An "Edit" button inside the modal switches to edit mode.

Files Modified:

- client/src/components/Insurance/InsuranceCard/InsuranceCard.jsx:
  Added onView prop, rendered "View" button next to "Edit" in card header

- client/src/components/Insurance/InsuranceCard/InsuranceCard.css:
  Added .insurance-card-view style (light blue pill, #e8f4ff bg, #017CFF text)
  Changed .insurance-card-edit to secondary style (gray text, no bg)

- client/src/components/Insurance/InsuranceModal/InsuranceModal.jsx:
  Added viewMode and onSwitchToEdit props
  View mode shows "Insurance Details" title
  Basic Info tab: label/value pairs for provider, plan, member ID, group, subscriber, relationship, effective date, phone, status badges
  Coverage tab: deductible/OOP progress bars, copays grid, coinsurance display
  Documents tab: unchanged (already read-only)
  Footer: single "Edit" button in view mode instead of Save/Cancel/Delete
  Hides scan card button and ConnectInsurance in view mode

- client/src/components/Insurance/InsuranceModal/InsuranceModal.css:
  Added .insurance-view-content, .insurance-view-section, .insurance-view-section-title
  Added .insurance-view-row, .insurance-view-label, .insurance-view-value
  Added .insurance-view-badge (with primary/active/inactive variants)
  Added .insurance-view-progress, .insurance-view-progress-header
  Added .insurance-view-copays-grid, .insurance-view-copay-item
  Added .insurance-view-empty, .insurance-modal-edit-btn
  Added mobile responsive overrides for view mode

- client/src/pages/MyInsurance/MyInsurance.jsx:
  Added viewMode state (boolean, default false)
  Added handleView() — sets editingInsurance, viewMode true, opens modal
  Modified handleEdit() — sets viewMode false
  Added handleSwitchToEdit() — sets viewMode false (modal stays open)
  Passed viewMode and onSwitchToEdit to InsuranceModal
  Passed onView to each InsuranceCard
  Reset viewMode to false on modal close

2026-02-05: Wellmark FHIR PKCE OAuth Implementation
----------------------------------------------------
Rewrote Wellmark FHIR integration to use PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)
OAuth flow instead of client_secret. Wellmark uses public client OAuth
which doesn't provide a client_secret — only App ID and x-api-key.

Files Modified:

- server/services/fhirService.js:
  Added generateCodeVerifier() using crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('base64url')
  Added generateCodeChallenge() using SHA256 hash
  Updated PROVIDERS.wellmark config with correct OAuth endpoints from capability statement
  Added usePKCE: true flag to provider config
  Updated getAuthorizationUrl() to accept codeVerifier param and add code_challenge/code_challenge_method=S256
  Updated exchangeCodeForTokens() to use code_verifier instead of client_secret
  Added x-api-key header to all requests

- server/routes/insurance.js:
  /fhir/authorize/:provider: Generate codeVerifier, store in state along with redirectUri
  /fhir/callback: Extract codeVerifier and redirectUri from state, pass to exchangeCodeForTokens

- server/.env:
  Cleaned up duplicate env vars
  Added WELLMARK_AUTH_URL, WELLMARK_TOKEN_URL, WELLMARK_FHIR_BASE_URL
  Added WELLMARK_CLIENT_ID, WELLMARK_SANDBOX_KEY, WELLMARK_PRODUCTION_KEY
  Added SERVER_URL=https://mymedicalcabinet.com

2026-02-05: Express Trust Proxy for Render Deployment
------------------------------------------------------
Fixed express-rate-limit ValidationError on Render. The X-Forwarded-For
header was being set by Render's reverse proxy but Express wasn't
configured to trust it.

Files Modified:

- server/server.js:
  Added app.set('trust proxy', 1) after Express app initialization
  This tells Express to trust the first proxy (Render's load balancer)

2026-02-05: FHIR Data Mapping to App Models
--------------------------------------------
Built mapping service to sync FHIR data directly into existing app sections
instead of just storing raw data. Now when user syncs insurance, data flows
into My Medications, My Medical Records, and My Doctors.

Files Created:

- server/services/fhirMappingService.js:
  Maps FHIR R4 resources to app schema:
  - MedicationRequest → Medication model (name, dosage, frequency, prescribedBy)
  - Condition → MedicalHistory.conditions (name, diagnosedDate, status)
  - AllergyIntolerance → MedicalHistory.allergies (allergen, reaction, severity)
  - Procedure → MedicalHistory.surgeries (procedure, date, surgeon, hospital)
  - Encounter → MedicalHistory.events (description, eventType, date, provider)
  - Immunization → MedicalHistory.events as vaccination type
  - Practitioner → Doctor model (name, specialty, phone, npiNumber)
  
  Handles deduplication:
  - First checks by FHIR resourceId (exact match)
  - Falls back to name matching (links manual entries to FHIR)
  - Skips true duplicates
  
  Returns sync summary with created/updated/skipped counts

Files Modified:

- server/models/Medication.js:
  Added fhirSource field { synced, provider, resourceId, lastSynced }

- server/models/MedicalHistory.js:
  Added fhirSource field to conditions, allergies, surgeries, events subdocs

- server/models/Doctor.js:
  Added fhirSource field

- server/models/Insurance.js:
  Added allergies array to fhirData schema

- server/services/fhirService.js:
  Added AllergyIntolerance to fetchPatientData resource list

- server/routes/insurance.js:
  Import fhirMappingService
  Call syncFhirDataToModels after fetching FHIR data
  Return detailed syncedToApp summary in response
  Updated disconnect to clear allergies array

2026-02-05: Wellmark ACA Limitation Notice
-------------------------------------------
Added a warning notice to the ConnectInsurance component explaining that
Wellmark data sync is only available for ACA Marketplace plans (purchased
through HealthCare.gov). Employer-sponsored and direct-purchase plans are
not supported by Wellmark's Patient Access API.

Files Modified:

- client/src/components/Insurance/ConnectInsurance/ConnectInsurance.jsx:
  Added yellow info notice box above the "Connect to Wellmark" button
  explaining the ACA plan requirement

- client/src/components/Insurance/ConnectInsurance/ConnectInsurance.css:
  Added .fhir-connect-notice styles (yellow/amber warning box)
  Added .fhir-connect-notice-text styles for title and description

2026-02-05: Insurance Provider Connection in Add Modal
-------------------------------------------------------
Added provider connection options at the top of the Add Insurance modal
so users see the option to auto-import data before manual entry.

  Added FHIR_PROVIDERS array with Wellmark config
  Added connectingProvider and connectError state
  Added handleProviderConnect function
  Added "Connect Your Insurance" section with provider cards
  Shows "ACA Plans Only" badge for Wellmark
  Added "Or enter manually" divider before form fields

- client/src/components/Insurance/InsuranceModal/InsuranceModal.css:
  Added .insurance-connect-section styles
  Added .insurance-connect-title and .insurance-connect-subtitle
  Added .insurance-provider-grid and .insurance-provider-card
  Added .insurance-provider-logo, .insurance-provider-info
  Added .insurance-provider-badge (amber for ACA notice)
  Added .insurance-provider-spinner for loading state
  Added .insurance-divider with "Or enter manually" styling

2026-02-06: Strong Password Requirements
-----------------------------------------
Implemented strong password validation for user registration to meet
security best practices and Humana API requirements.

Files Modified:

- server/routes/auth.js:
  Updated password validation to require:
  - Minimum 8 characters (was 6)
  - At least one uppercase letter
  - At least one lowercase letter
  - At least one number
  - At least one special character (!@#$%^&* etc.)

- client/src/components/SignupModal/SignupModal.jsx:
  Added real-time password strength validation
  Added passwordRequirements object tracking each requirement
  Added isPasswordValid computed value
  Added visual checklist showing requirements met/unmet
  Updated form validation to use new requirements
