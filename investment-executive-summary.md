## The Team: A Power Triangle Built for Scale

### David Disbrow — Chief Executive Officer
**30+ years in medical administration | Former AVP, Mednax**

David brings unparalleled domain expertise in healthcare operations, strategic growth, and B2B partnerships. At Mednax—one of the nation's largest physician services companies—he led administrative functions across multi-site pediatric and neonatal practices. His relationships with hospital systems, payer networks, and clinical leadership provide immediate distribution channels for MyMedicalCabinet's enterprise offering.

### Patrick Morocco — Chief Financial Officer
**Business Solutions Architect, DXC Technology | Former Dell, HPE**

Patrick is a systems-level financial architect with deep experience in enterprise pricing models, SaaS economics, and operational scale. His tenure at DXC, Dell, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise positions him to build the financial infrastructure required for venture-scale growth: unit economics modeling, contract structuring for health systems, and capital-efficient expansion.

### James McEwen — Chief Technology Officer
**Full-Stack MERN Developer | Technical Founder**

James designed and built the entire MyMedicalCabinet platform as a solo technical founder—a fully functional MVP with 40+ React components, 11 API route modules, and integrations with RxNav, OpenFDA, NPI Registry, Google Places, and SendGrid. The architecture prioritizes privacy-by-design (client-side OCR), security (AES-256 encryption, JWT authentication, rate limiting), and mobile performance (PWA with offline capability).

## The Value Proposition

### Clinical Data Bridge for Pediatric Care

The pediatric care market presents a unique opportunity: fragmented records across pediatricians, specialists, urgent care, and school health systems—managed by parents who are highly motivated but technologically underserved. David Disbrow's Mednax network provides direct access to this vertical.

**MyMedicalCabinet enables:**
- Instant record sharing during ER visits (allergies, medications, immunizations)
- Medication management with interaction alerts (critical for multi-provider pediatric patients)
- Appointment coordination across specialists
- Insurance verification and claims documentation

### High-Margin SaaS Economics

The platform is architected for SaaS-native economics:

| Metric | Current State | 12-Month Target |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| Infrastructure Cost | ~$200/mo (Render + Atlas + S3) | <$0.50/user/mo at scale |
| Gross Margin Target | — | 85%+ |
| CAC Efficiency | Organic + clinical partnerships | <$25 CAC via B2B2C |
| LTV Potential | — | $150+ (premium tiers + enterprise) |

**Revenue Model:**
- **B2C Freemium:** Free tier with premium upgrades ($4.99–$9.99/mo)
- **B2B2C Enterprise:** Per-member licensing to pediatric practices, hospital systems, and self-insured employers
- **Data Intelligence (Future):** Anonymized, aggregated insights for pharmaceutical and payer partners (with explicit consent)

## Why Now: Regulatory Tailwinds

**2026 marks a compliance inflection point:**

1. **FTC Health Breach Notification Rule** (effective 2026): Non-HIPAA health apps now face federal breach notification requirements—raising the compliance bar and eliminating casual competitors.

2. **CMS Interoperability Mandates:** Payers and providers are required to support patient access APIs, creating demand for consumer-facing tools that can receive and organize this data.

3. **Post-Pandemic Patient Expectations:** Patients now expect digital-first healthcare experiences. The market is primed for a trusted, privacy-focused personal health record.
